        <p>I'm a professional photographer who's interested in communication and everything about it. I've recently became interested in web programming, and a few months ago I won a scholarship for a Front-end development bootcamp at Ironhack. 

I am a creative and perseverant person who's now looking for a first job as a front-end. I'm keen to gain more experience in the field and learn from other developers.</p>
